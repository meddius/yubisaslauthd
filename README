DESCRIPTION

yubisaslauthd is a replacement for saslauthd for the single purpose of
providing two-factor Yubikey-based authentication with LDAP.

BEHAVIOR

The username is the DN of the user to validate. The password is the user's
password concatenated with a Yubikey OTP. Realm and service are ignored.
yubisaslauthd validates the OTP against the Yubikey API, verifies that the
Yubikey ID is associated with the given user, and verifies the password. The
Yubikey ID to user mappings and the password hashes are stored in LDAP.
Password hashes use crypt(3).

For use with LDAP, each user's userPassword attribute should be set to
{SASL}<dn>, where <dn> is the full DN of the user. The user's actual password
should be stored in crypt(3) form in a separate attribute, specified as
LDAP_PASSWD_ATTR.

CONFIGURATION

Items you may want to configure:

Socket path: SOCK_PATH in yubisaslauthd.py. Defaults to /var/run/saslauthd/mux,
  the standard saslauthd path on Debian/Ubuntu.
Number of preforked workers: NUM_WORKERS in yubisaslauthd.py. Defaults to 5;
  may need increasing if you have a slow LDAP server, slow Yubikey API, and/or
  a high volume of auth requests.
API Client ID: CLIENT_ID in validate.py.
API Client Key: CLIENT_KEY in validate.py. Set these to the ID and key for API
  access.
LDAP Yubikey attribute: LDAP_YUBI_ATTR in validate.py. This is the user
  attribute that contains the user's Yubikey ID.
LDAP password attribute: LDAP_PASSWD_ATTR in validate.py. This is the user
  attribute that contains the user's hashed password.
LDAP bind credentials: By default, yubisaslauthd connects using a unix socket
  (ldapi:///) and uses EXTERNAL authentication. If you need a different method,
  modify the ldap_connect method in validate.py.
Yubikey API URL: API_URLS in yubico/yubico.py.
Yubikey API trusted CAs: CA_CERTS in yubico/httplib_ssl.py.

OTHER

The Yubikey API library is taken from python-yubico-client, at
